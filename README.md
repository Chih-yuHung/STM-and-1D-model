# STM-and-1D-model
In this project, Sasha Hafner and Chih-Yu Hung compared the performance two slurry temperature model with three data set measured in Canada, Denmark, and Sweden. 


# Input files
## Ottawa data
  The weather data, air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and RH were obtained from Environment Canada. The missing data were interpolated. The solar radiation data were purchased from the Climatology Services. Maximum solar radiations were the maximum solar radiation for the period of 1971-2000 which were used in Rennie et al., 2021. 



# Output files/measured data
## Ottawa data
    The measured manure temperature data from Ottawa was obtained in 2020. Manure temperatures at four depths (surface, upper, middle, which is 1m below surface, and bottom) were measured. The avg. manure temperature were weighted based on the depth.
